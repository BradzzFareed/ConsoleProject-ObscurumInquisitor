# Music Problem
We have received complaints that players are unable to play the gmae proper due to an error. We have identified that the method GameMusic(string filepath) is unable to locate the .wav music file that is supposedly in the filepath: ConsoleProject-ObscurumInquisitor/bin/Debug/net8.0.

To solve this problem, we have uploaded the music file here and moving the .wav file to the specified filepath location should fix the problem.
Here is the link to the file: [Music](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SNQWwxeCDBx3-vyK_Xz3SaRJJW5mK6zO?usp=sharing)
